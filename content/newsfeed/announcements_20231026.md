## City Web Viewer Updated

The Web Viewer will no longer prompt users to sign in to ECSO-911.  County services have switched to a view-only version for greater security.

If you detect an issue with the City Web Viewer, contact our staff at [gis@grantspassoregon.gov](mailto:gis@grantspassoregon.gov).
