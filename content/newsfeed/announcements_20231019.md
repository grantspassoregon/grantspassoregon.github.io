## Web Links Added to Online Viewer

Staff and residents can now view planning agreements (Deferred Development, Fee in Lieu, Advanced Finance District, Service and Annexation) on the City Web Viewer.  The popup field for these assets will display a link under "Document: View".  Clicking on "View" will open the pdf in a new browser tab.  Existing links in the GIS layer to these files on the employee network drives are still available and not affected by this change.

The popup field for the tax parcel layers (City and County versions) now displays a link to the assessment map. Clicking on "View" will open the pdf in a new browser tab.  This differs from the behavior of the Josephine County Property Assessment Map, where the document link downloads the file to your PC.
