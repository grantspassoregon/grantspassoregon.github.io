A commonly-requested feature for the City Web Viewer is access to public documents, such as final plats or financial agreements, including Fee in Lieu, Deferred Development, Service & Annexation Agreements or Advance Finance Districts.  We are pleased to announce that the new version of the Web Viewer map includes web links to these various public documents, making them accessible to view and download for members of the public.

To access final plats, turn on the visibility of the Subdivision Plats layer in the Property category of the Layers widget.  When you click on a feature, the viewing link will appear in the pop-up menu:

{{ fig_begin(caption = "Web Link for Final Plats.") }}
<img src="../../public/content/newsfeed/web_links_plats.png">
{{ fig_end() }}
<!-- <img src=/content/newsfeed/web_links_plats.png alt="Web Links for Final Plats" width=300> -->

To access City financial agreements, turn on the appropriate layer in the Planning category under Agreements and Financial sub-heading.  When you click on a feature, the viewing link will appear in the pop-up menu:

{{ fig_begin(caption = "Web Link for AFDs.") }}
<img src=/content/newsfeed/web_links_afd.png alt="Web Links for AFDs" width=300>
{{ fig_end() }}

Preparing this service for public access was a non-trivial process, because the City computer network was not set up to support this functionality.  Staff at the City access work documents using a shared network drive.  Our GIS layers often include links to documents on our network drive, and in ArcGIS these links will open the document on a PC that is operating on our internal network.  In the past, when the public wanted access to these documents, they would drop by the planning counter in person, or contact a member of our staff by email or phone.

To facilitate public viewing and download, staff migrated storage of these documents to the City website, adding web links to over 4,000 features on the Web Viewer map.  If you discover a link that fails to open, or desire access to an additional class of documents, please let us know at [gis@grantspassoregon.gov](emailto:gis@grantspassoregon.gov).
